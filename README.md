This was my attempt at the envited technical assessment round for a student intern role.

I replicated the landing page for the larger aspect ration quite well but I hardcoded the height and width from figma which made it harder to make it responsive, I should have just used containers and flex-wrap.

Also was trying to setup react-router-dom for the event page but couldn't do it in the given time frame.

I don't have much experience with react and feel like I did ok.
